This repository holds odbc driver written in go.

It implements database driver interface as used by standard database/sql package.
Calls into odbc dll on Windows, and uses cgo everywhere else.

This forked repo is an experiment or attempt at a rewrite to support UTF-8 and non-W syscalls on Unix which seems to be the only way to get Teradata ODBC driver working without using Data Direct proprietary driver manager.
